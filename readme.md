# Pixel Art Maker

This simplistic pixel art maker is an experiment in using Web Components and HTML5 Canvas.  There are (currently) two main Components, PixelCanvas and ColorPallet. For now, the PixelCanvas is dependent on the ColorPallet. The live version can be found on [github pages](https://tebba-von-mathenstein.github.io/pixel-art-maker/).

## Running The Code

There are no dependencies -- everything here is HTML5, CSS3, and ES6. Clone this repo and open `index.html` in your favorite modern browser.

## Motivation

This is simply a playground application to practice, and stay on top of the emerging Web Components standard. There are a number of features I'd love to add to make the editor more usable and interesting, yet my primary goal for this project is to learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of Web Components. Please fork/clone/distribute/alter to your hearts content.
